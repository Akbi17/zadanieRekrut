Project Overview
    This project is a cryptocurrency screener designed to monitor various crypto assets traded on the Binance exchange. The screener allows users to keep track of market movements and performance indicators of selected cryptocurrencies in real-time. The screener is organized into four distinct sections, each serving a specific purpose:

    Top Raises
    Top Lowest
    Top Transactions
    Top Volume
Key Features
    Real-Time Market Data: The screener pulls and updates data in real-time to provide the latest market conditions and performance metrics.
    Multiple Sections: The screener is divided into four main sections, each providing a different perspective on the market:
    Top Raises: Displays cryptocurrencies with the highest price increases over a specified period.
    Top Lowest: Lists the cryptocurrencies with the largest price decreases.
    Top Transactions: Focuses on the cryptocurrencies with the highest number of transactions.
    Top Volume: Highlights cryptocurrencies with the highest trading volumes.
User Interface
    The interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, featuring multiple small charts arranged in a grid format. Each chart represents a different cryptocurrency pair (e.g., FLOKI/USDT, BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT), with key information such as:

    Price (Open, High, Low, Close)
    Volume of trades
    Candlestick charts for visual representation
    Real-time data updates
How to Use
    Navigation: Use the tabs to switch between the different sections (Top Raises, Top Lowest, Top Transactions, Top Volume).
    Viewing Data: Each section presents the data in a grid format where each cell represents a different cryptocurrency pair. The charts can be viewed in various timeframes (1m, 30m, 1h, etc.).
    Real-Time Monitoring: The screener automatically updates to reflect the latest market conditions, allowing users to monitor the market continuously without manual refresh.
Technology Stack
    Data Source: Binance API for fetching real-time cryptocurrency data.
    Frontend: The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with integration for real-time charting and data visualization.
    Backend: The backend is developed using PHP Symfony 7.1 , managing API requests and data processing.
